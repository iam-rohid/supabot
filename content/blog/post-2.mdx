## Analytics that matter

On top of fast redirects, a link management tool also needs data visualization to help marketing teams understand the performance of their links.

Dub provides you with powerful analytics for your short links, including geolocation, device, browser, and referrer information.

## Use your own custom domain for free

Dub also allows you to use your own custom domain for free. This is especially useful for marketing teams that want to use their own branded domain for short links.

## Fully open-source and self-hostable

Dub is also fully open-source, released under the AGPLv3 license.

This means you can clone, modify, and even deploy your own instance of Dub, as long as you open-source it.
